/**

npm install -g parcel-bundler

/**
 * to make it work, we just include an index.ts inside a script tag, at the bottom of our index.html body
 * then we run the application with the command:
 */
parcel index.html 

/**
 * when we do so, parcel is going to render all the typescript and transform the index.ts into index.jss
